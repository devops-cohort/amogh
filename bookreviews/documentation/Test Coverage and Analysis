Analysis:
An analysis of the test coverage shows both areas of strength and areas that need improvement with regard to the implementation of testing.
Particular highlights include the 100% coverage of __init__.py, and the relatively high scores of 91% and 86% on forms.py and models.py
respectively. The weakest area of test coverage was on routes.py, with only 30% coverage. Overall, pytest achieved a coverage of 56%, which
is a decent percentage considering that I only carried out unit testing, and not integration testing. I believe that in order to improve test
coverage on routes.py, I would need to include a form of integration testing such as Selenium testing - this is a major area for
potential improvement in the future.

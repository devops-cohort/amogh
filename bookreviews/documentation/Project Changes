I am pleased to report that the final web application exceeds the scope of the initial plan. Initially, I was planning to have create,
read, update and delete functionality on only the Users table, while the Reviews table would only have create and read functionality. While
this would have fulfilled the requirements for the minimum viable product, I decided that the ability to change and delete reviews was
essential for a satisfying user experience. The implementation of update and delete functionality for the Reviews table proved to be
considerably more difficult than for the Users table, due to the many-to-one relationship between users and reviews, as well as the added
complication of user authentication before allowing a review to be updated or deleted. However, I believe that the vastly improved user
experience outweighs the time investment for implementing these features, and more than justifies this addition to the project.

In terms of future development, there are two key areas that I would focus on. Firstly, I would think about using Bootstrap to improve the
aesthetics of the website. While I did not want to do this for the SFIA project as I wished to keep the code as 'homegrown' as possible, in
the long term I believe that the front end design of the web application would be crucial to its appeal to users. Secondly, as mentioned in
my test analysis, I would look at integrating Selenium integration testing, as this would provide a considerably higher test coverage and
ultimately increase faith in the reliability of the application.
